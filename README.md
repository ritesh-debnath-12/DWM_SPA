# DWM_SPA

I was assigned to build a SPA for SIH-2023(PS:1322). As we were not selected, the team was disbanded.
This webpage now remains defunct, and no further work is done on it.

# Can I use it?

Sure! Its a React project made using pnpm and vite. To run it locally, follow these steps:
- Download git, open a terminal and put these commands
- git clone "https://github.com/ritesh-debnath-12/DWM_SPA"
- cd DWM_SPA
- pnpm install
- pnpm run dev

I think it was pnpm run dev, if its not, then please check the json files
